Module to generate chord inversions and different chord voicings.
See the module perldocs for more information on usage, or eg/mcp2ly
for a CLI tool.

Install from CPAN:

  cpan Music::Chord::Positions

Or the latest version:

  git clone http://github.com/thrig/Music-Chord-Positions
  cd Music-Chord-Positions
  cpanm .

Or the old fashioned way:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

TODO

Much bugfixing and refactoring and improvements (inversions, etc).
